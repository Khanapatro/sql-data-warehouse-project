# 🏗️ Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse Project** repository! 🚀  

This is my **first data warehousing project**, built using **SQL Server**. The goal of this project is to understand the fundamentals of **data warehousing and analytics** by designing a structured data warehouse and generating insights from it.

In this project, I have built a complete data warehouse and **created analytical outputs for customers and products** to support reporting and business analysis.

## 🏛️ Data Architecture

The project follows a **layered (Medallion) architecture**:

1. **Bronze Layer**  
   Stores raw data ingested from source systems (CSV files) into SQL Server without modification.

2. **Silver Layer**  
   Performs data cleansing, standardization, and transformation to ensure data quality and consistency.

3. **Gold Layer**  
   Contains analytics-ready data modeled using **fact and dimension tables**, which are used for **customer and product analytics**.

## 📊 Analytics Overview

Using the **Gold layer**, I have created analytics focused on:

- Customer analysis (customer details, demographics, and activity)
- Product analysis (product categories, pricing, and sales behavior)

These analytics help demonstrate how warehouse data can be transformed into meaningful business insights.

## 📖 Project Scope

This project covers:

- Designing a modern **SQL Server data warehouse**
- Building **ETL pipelines** to load and transform data
- Creating **fact and dimension tables** for analytics
- Developing **customer and product analytics** from the Gold layer
